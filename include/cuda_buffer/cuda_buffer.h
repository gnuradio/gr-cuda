 * \brief Subclass of buffer_single_mapped for supporting blocks using NVidia's
 * CUDA runtime.
 *
 * This buffer_single_mapped subclass is designed to provide easy buffer support
 * for blocks using NVidia's CUDA runtime. The class acts as a wrapper for two
 * underlying buffers, a host buffer allocated using the cudaMallocHost()
 * function and a device buffer allocated using the cudaMalloc() function.
 * The logic contained within this class manages both buffers and the movement
 * of data between the two depending on the buffer's assigned context.
